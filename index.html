									<h2><a href="#">The Day i Knew U Were Mine</a></h2>
									<p>I know we  were not in a relationship then, but i felt i was in one. I remember the look you had in your eyes,i remember the lipstick u wore,i remember the pullover u wore, i rememember how pretty you were..you were so perfect that night...that bike ride, the way we intertwined our fingers, our first hug.. i will never forget the weather,the road and peace that i felt when i knew that the moment i had been waiting for so long was finally here and it was exactly as i wanted it to be..it all seemed so perfect..i wanted to just stop the moment right there neither move forward nor backward because this was how i always wanted it to be..whenever i see this picture all i can remember is how perfect we are</p>
